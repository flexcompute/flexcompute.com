  title: FDTD101
  description: "This course is an introduction to the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Method for electromagnetics. You will learn the fundamental concepts behind electromagnetic simulation, the common sources of errors in FDTD simulations, and many advanced topics worth considering when you set up your simulations. The course includes video lectures and tutorials, and we will walk you through the basics of setting up and running electromagnetic simulations. We will use Flexcompute's Tidy3D solver for its examples, and the scripts used in the slides are publicly accessible from this website. Basic knowledge of electromagnetics and programming is recommended to get the most use out of this course."
