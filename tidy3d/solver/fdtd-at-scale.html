          description: 'As simulations scale to enormous sizes, the bottleneck becomes the communication between computation domains. Tightly integrating the advanced computation hardware with the software design, Tidy3D is specifically optimized for solving Maxwell’s equations. Its intelligent decomposition minimizes the communications overhead for massive simulations. Simulations of tens of billions of grid points are routinely performed.'

          description: "This large-scale three-dimensional metalens has a diameter of 100 wavelengths. This seemly tiny device is an enormous physical size for full-wave simulations. At λ/18 resolution, this translates into 2.7 Billion grid cells. This problem would be practically infeasible using conventional FDTD, even with cloud computing. With Tidy3D, this record-size simulation finishes in less than 300 seconds."
