  new_features:
  - Case got a new 3D visualisation tab (with “beta” label) available for all new
    submissions, not only the latest solver version. New visualisation shows q-criterion
    and surface results (Cp, Cf, CfVec and y+) for noSlipWalls.
  - Pre-submission validation warnings are presented to the user
  - The volume meshing page accepts the parameter “refinement” for refinement zones
    (solver version release-22.3.3.0)
  - daily.cost.s3 is hidden by default from the account page
  resolved_issues:
  - Large scale surface meshes can be now viewed in the 3D surface mesh viewer
  - Input for solver tolerances now accepts 1e-10
  - Not showing prompts for the case generator then nothing was changed.
  - Fork is not available from a case with status=error/diverged
