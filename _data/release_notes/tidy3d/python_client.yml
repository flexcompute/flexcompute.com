      <br>

      1. Tidy3D component .to_hdf5() and .from_hdf5() now accept custom encoder
      and decoder functions for more flexible IO.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. JaxDataArrays are properly handled when reading and writing to file,
      dramatically reducing the VJP simulation download size in server-side
      adjoint.

      <br>

      2. A bug in a total-field scattered-field (TFSF) validator which was
      causing unnecessary errors when a TFSF surface intersected with 2D
      materials.

      <br>

      3. CI tests working with binary installation of gdstk instead of compiling
      from source.

      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. Downgrade typing_extensions to <=4.5.0 to avoid bug with pydantic for
      python <= 3.9.

      <br>

      <b>Added</b>

      <br>

      1. Fully anisotropic medium class (FullyAnisotropicMedium) that allows to
      simulate materials with permittivity and conductivity tensors oriented
      arbitrary with respect to simulation grid.

      <br>

      2. Adjoint processing is done server side by default, to avoid unnecessary
      downloading of data.

      <br>

      3. JaxPolySlab in adjoint plugin, which can track derivatives through its
      .vertices.

      <br>

      4. run_local and run_async_local options in tidy3d.plugins.adjoint.web to
      provide way to run adjoint processing locally.

      <br>

      5. web.test() to simply test if the authentication is configured correctly
      and raise exception otherwise.

      <br>

      6. SimulationTask.get_running_tasks() to get a list of running tasks from
      the server.

      <br>

      7. Retry for set number of seconds in web functions if internet connection
      errors.

      <br>

      8. Argument scale to ModeSolver.plot_field to control plot scaling.

      <br><br>


      <b>Changed</b>

      <br>

      1. Perfect electric conductors (PECs) are now modeled as high-conductivity
      media in both the frontend and backend mode solvers, and their presence
      triggers the use of a preconditioner to improve numerical stability and
      robustness. Consequently, the mode solver provides more accurate
      eigenvectors and field distributions when PEC structures are present.

      <br>

      2. Include source amplitude in amp_time.

      <br>

      3. Increased the maximum allowed estimated simulation data storage to
      50GB. Individual monitors with projected data larger than 10GB will
      trigger a warning.

      <br>

      4. PolySlab.inside now uses matplotlib.path.contains_points for better
      performance.

      <br>

      5. JaxCustomMedium accepts a maximum of 250,000 grid cells to avoid slow
      server-side processing.

      <br><BR>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. Log messages provide the correct caller origin (file name and line
      number).

      <br>

      2. Medium2D is removed from the list of allowed options for
      Simulation.medium in the documentation.

      <br>

      3. Symmetry works properly in adjoint plugin.

      <b>Changed</b>

      <br>

      1. adjoint plugin now filters out adjoint sources that are below a
      threshold in amplitude relative to the maximum amplitude of the monitor
      data, reducing unnecessary processing by eliminating sources that won’t
      contribute to the gradient.

      <br>

      2. web.run_async uses Batch under the hood instead of asyncio.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. More helpful error messages from HTTP responses.

      <br>

      2. Bug in _validate_no_structures_pml, which was using wrong pml
      thicknesses.

      tidy3d.web.configure(apikey: str) function.

      <br><br>


      <b>Changed</b>

      <br>

      1. adjoint plugin now filters out adjoint sources that are below a
      threshold in amplitude relative to the maximum amplitude of the monitor
      data, reducing unnecessary processing by eliminating sources that won’t
      contribute to the gradient.

      <br>

      2. ArrayLike fields use np.ndarray internally instead of TidyNDArray
      subclass. Tidy3D objects are no longer hashable, instead, hash the
      obj.json() string.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. web.Batch monitoring is more robust, will not raise exception if a job

      <b>Changed</b>

      <br>

      1. Times logged in tidy3d.log during solver run now split into Solver time
      (time-stepping only), Field projection time (after the time stepping if
      any field projection monitors present) and Data write time (when the raw
      data is packaged to disk). Previously, Solver time used to include the
      Field projection time and not Data write time.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. Port name duplication in smatrix plugin for multimode ports.

      <br>

      2. Web functions create the leading directories for the supplied filename
      if they don’t exist.

      <br>

      3. Some docstring examples that were giving warnings.

      simulation has 0 size, to fix plotting issues for 2D simulations.

      <br>

      6. Improved PEC handling around curved interfaces and structure
      intersections. Old handling accessible with subpixel=False (previously, it
      was independent of the subpixel setting).

      <br>

      8. PointDipole sources now have a continuous dependence on the source
      position, as opposed to snapping to Yee grid locations. Behavior is
      controlled by the interpolate argument, set to True by default.

      <br>

      9. smatrix plugin accepts list of frequencies and returns data as an
      xarray.DataArray instead of a nested dict.

      <br>

      10. importlib-metadata version set to >= 6.0.0.

      6. Limit some warnings to only show for the first structure for which they
      are encountered.

      <br>

      7. Billed flex unit no longer shown at the end of web.run as it may take a
      few seconds until it is available. Instead, added a web.real_cost(task_id)
      function to get the cost after a task run.

      <br>

      8. Refactored tidy3d.web for more robustness and test coverage.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. Progressbars always set to 100% when webapi functions are finished.

      <br>

      2. Faster handling of Geometry.intersects and Geometry.inside by taking
      into account geometry bounds.

      <br>

      3. Numpy divide by zero warning in mode solver fixed by initializing
      jacobians as real instead of complex.

      <br>

      4. Bug in validators for 2D objects being in homogeneous media which were
      looking at the infinite plane in which the objects lie. This can also
      significantly speed up some validators in the case of many structures.

      <br>

      5. Sources and monitors with bend radii are displayed with curved arrows.

      <b>Added</b>

      <br>

      1. CustomFieldSource that can inject arbitrary source fields.

      <br>

      2. ElectromagneticFieldData.flux property for data corresponding to 2D
      monitors, and ElectromagneticFieldData.dot method for computing the
      overlap integral over two sets of frequency-domain field data.

      <br>

      3. Data corresponding to 2D FieldMonitor and FieldTimeMonitor, as well as
      to ModeSolverMonitor, now also stores grid_correction data related to the
      finite grid along the normal direction. This needs to be taken into
      account to avoid e.g. numerical oscillations of the flux with the exact
      position of the monitor that is due to the interpolation from the grid
      cell boundaries. These corrections are automatically applied when using
      the flux and dot methods.

      <br>

      4. Resonance finding plugin for estimating resonance frequency and
      Q-factor of multiple resonances from time-domain data. Accessed through
      tidy3d.plugins.ResonanceFinder.

      <br>

      5. New .updated_copy(**kwargs) method to all tidy3d objects to add a more
      convenient shortcut to copying an instance with updated fields, i.e.
      med.copy(update=dict(permittivity=3.0)) becomes
      med.updated_copy(permittivity=3.0).

      <br>

      6. Test support for python 3.11.

      <br>

      7. sidewall_angle option for Cylinder that allows a Cylinder to be tuned
      into a conical frustum or a cone.

      <br>

      8. reference_plane for PolySlab that provides options to define the
      vertices at the bottom, middle, or top of the PolySlab.

      <br>

      9. Automesh generation: MeshOverrideStructure that allows for a direct
      grid size specification in override structures, and dl_min that bounds the
      minimal grid size.

      <br>

      10. More material models to the material database such as gold from
      Olman2012.

      <br>

      11. In AdvancedFitterParam for StableDispersionFitter, random_seed option
      to set the random seed, and bound_f_lower to set the lower bound of pole
      frequency.

      <br>

      12. Introduced the option to project fields at near, intermediate, and far
      distances using an exact Green’s function formalism which does not make
      far-field approximations. This can be enabled in any
      AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor by setting far_field_approx=False. A
      tutorial notebook as a comprehensive reference for field projections was
      added to the documentation.

      <br>

      13. Tracking of modes in ModeSolverData based on overlap values,
      controlled through ModeSpec.track_freq.

      <br>

      14. Native broadband support for GassuainBeam AstigmaticGaussianBeam, and
      ModeSource through the num_freqs argument.

      <br>

      15. Apodization option for frequency-domain monitors to ignore temporal
      data in the beginning and/or end of a simulation

      <br><br>


      <b>Changed</b>

      <br>

      1. Minimum flex unit charge reduced from 0.1 to 0.025.

      <br>

      2. Default courant factor was changed from 0.9 to 0.99.

      <br>

      3. A point dipole source placed on a symmetry plane now always has twice
      the amplitude of the same source in a simulation without the symmetry
      plane, as expected by continuity with the case when the dipole is slightly
      off the symmetry plane, in which case there are effectively two dipoles,
      the original one and its mirror image. Previously, the amplitude was only
      doubled for dipoles polarized normal to the plane, because of Yee grid
      specifics.

      <br>

      4. FluxMonitor and FluxTimeMonitor no longer snap fields to centers, but
      instead provide continuous interpolation of the flux over the exact
      geometry of the monitor.

      <br>

      5. Major refactor to internal handling of data structures, including pure
      Dataset components that do not depend on other Tidy3D components and may
      therefore be used to define custom data in Tidy3D models.

      <br>

      6. Speed and memory usage improvement when writing and reading Tidy3d
      models to and from .hdf5 files.

      <br>

      7. Writing Tidy3D models containing custom data to .json file will log a
      warning and exclude the raw data from the file for performance reasons.

      <br>

      8. Material database reorganization and fixing a few references to the
      dispersion data.

      <br>

      9. The name Near2Far has been replaced with FieldProjection. For example,
      Near2FarAngleMonitor is now FieldProjectionAngleMonitor.

      <br>

      10. The API for far field projections has been simplified and several
      methods have now become properties. For example, the radar cross section
      is now accessed as .radar_cross_section, not .radar_cross_section().

      <br>

      11. Added a method renormalize_fields to AbstractFieldProjectionData to
      re-project far fields to different projection distances.

      <br>

      12. The API for DiffractionData was refactored to unify it with the API
      for AbstractFieldProjectionData.

      <br>

      13. The user no longer needs to supply orders_x and orders_y when creating
      a DiffractionMonitor; all allowed orders are automatically generated and
      returned in the resulting DiffractionData.

      <br>

      14. The user no longer needs to supply a medium when creating a
      DiffractionMonitor or any AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor; the medium
      through which fields are to be projected is now determined automatically
      based on the medium in which the monitor is placed.

      <br>

      15. The following attributes of AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor are now
      properties rather than methods: fields_spherical, fields_cartesian, power,
      radar_cross_section.

      <br><br>


      <b>Fixed</b>

      <br>

      1. Some issues in DiffractionMonitor that is not z-normal that could lead
      to solver errors or wrong results.

      <br>

      2. Bug leading to solver error when Absorber boundaries with num_layers =
      0 are used.

      <br>

      3. Bug leading to solver error when a FieldMonitor crosses a BlochBoundary
      and not all field components are recorded.

      <br>

      4. When running a Batch, path_dir is created if not existing.

      <br>

      5. Ignore shapely STRtree deprecation warning.

      <br>

      6. Ignore x axis when plotting 1D Simulation cross sections to avoid plot
      irregularities.

      <br>

      7. Local web api tests.

      <br>

      8. Use Tidy3D logger for some warnings that used to use default python
      logging

      This new version brings some major internal reorganizations, and a number
      of new features and bug fixes. 

      <br>

      The full list of changes can be found <a
      href="https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/tidy3d/en/latest/changelog.html">HERE</a>.

      <br>

      <b>We would like to highlight some simulation pricing changes starting
      from this release:</b>

      <br>

      1. We have worked on reducing our overhead and are happy to announce that
      we are decreasing the minimum charge per task from 0.2 to 0.1 flex units.

      <br>

      2. We have reduced the typical cost premium for dispersive materials in
      simulations, especially when only part of the simulation is dispersive.

      <br>

      3. We have added a cost for monitors, but this will be negligible in
      typical simulations, and will only be non-negligible for very large
      monitors. For example, for a very large frequency-domain monitor at many
      frequencies, such that the number of pixels in the monitor span times the
      number of frequencies is similar to the total number of pixels in the
      simulation, the charge for the monitor will still be only a fraction of
      the current charge for the simulation run.
