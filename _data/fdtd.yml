  - title: Adjoint-Optimized Quantum Emitter Light Extractor
    enabled: true
    description: >-
      In quantum technologies, the role of quantum emitters cannot be
      overstated. These nanoscale entities, ranging from quantum dots and atoms
      to color centers in crystals, are pivotal in emitting single photons - a
      cornerstone for quantum applications. However, a significant challenge
      lies in efficiently extracting this light, often hindered by its weak and
      uncontrolled emission characteristics. To address this, we highlight a
      case study featuring an adjoint-optimized quantum emitter light extractor
      at the start of this new year. This optimized design achieves an
      impressive extraction efficiency exceeding 80% and maintains a remarkably
      compact footprint.

    description: >-
      Air conditioning accounts for about 10% of global electricity use, and
      demand is projected to rise significantly. New approaches like radiative
      cooling can reduce this

      In this case we study on how to set up an FDTD simulation and measure the
      performance of a typical CMOS RGB image sensor composed of a periodic
      arrangement of Bayer unit cells.
