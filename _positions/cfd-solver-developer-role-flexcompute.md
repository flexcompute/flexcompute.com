We believe that the best solutions are created through collaboration, and we encourage our team members to work together to solve complex problems. We also believe in supporting our team members in achieving their goals and providing opportunities for growth.

## **Location:**

Boston, MA

## **Job Summary:**

Flexcompute is seeking an experienced software developer to contribute to a modern Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation software designed for multi-node CPUs and GPUs. The successful candidate will have a critical role in designing and implementing cutting-edge algorithms with an emphasis on speed, robustness, accuracy, and scalability. This position offers a unique opportunity to explore state-of-the-art CFD and computational geometry algorithms in a production environment. The candidate will gain experience working with highly experienced professionals and be an integral part of the product development, release, maintenance, and support phases. Over time, the strong collaborative nature of this role offers exposure to Flexcompute's sophisticated multi-physics simulation and design optimization technologies.

## **What You Will Do:**

* Independently implement, test, and document new solver and meshing features
* Profile and optimize feature implementation to improve speed and scalability on CPUs/GPUs
* Contribute to a clean and maintainable API for various functionalities
* Contribute to general source code maintenance and other relevant software development activities (bug fixes, support, etc)
* Collaborate with teams developing the user-interface and scientific visualization tools/technologies
* Collaborate with Product Management, QA, and Documentation teams to accomplish product milestones in a timely manner
* Follow sound software engineering practices. The code we write today will underpin our platform simulation products for years to come â€“ it needs to be maintainable, extensible and robust
* Make user experience a priority. We strive to make the complexity inherent in fluid simulations manageable by way of intuitive controls and straightforward workflows
* Deliver robust and high-performance simulations for industrial applications that involve management of large amounts of data

## **What You Will Need:**

### **Basics:**

* Strong background in Fluid Mechanics, Structural Mechanics, Aeroacoustics, Conjugate Heat Transfer, or adjacent fields
* Knowledge of numerical methods for solving discretized Navier Stokes equations for Incompressible or Compressible Flows
* Basics of computational geometry and meshing requirements for CFD simulations
* Proven experience in and contributions to complex CFD solvers
* C++ for scientific computing and Python (or similar) for scripting
* Master degree or PhD in an applicable technical field with 0-3 years of industry experience
* Familiar with version control systems such as git and the Linux command line

### **Preferred:**

* Industry experience with implementation and testing of new features in commercial CFD solvers
* Prior experience in working collaboratively in a medium sized distributed development team
* PhD in Computational Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering or Aerospace Engineering
* Expertise in one or more of the following topics:
  * Linear solvers and convergence acceleration of CFD solvers (Multigrid algorithms, etc)
  * Immersed Boundary, Overset, Adaptive Mesh Refinement methods
  * Turbulence modeling and wall-functions (RANS, hybrid RANS-LES)
  * Multi-physics simulations: including fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer
  * Surface and volumetric meshing for CFD
  * Development of scalable, parallel CFD solvers using MPI, OpenMP, or CUDA

## **How You Will Be Successful:**

We welcome you to apply even if you don't match every requirement posted for this role.&nbsp; No one candidate will be a 100% perfect match to our description, so if you are passionate about working on the next evolution in simulation software and have similar experience to what we are looking for, we encourage you to apply.&nbsp; Diverse backgrounds and experiences promote innovation, and our goal is to build a team that encompasses a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and skills.

## **What We Offer:**

* Competitive salary and benefits package
