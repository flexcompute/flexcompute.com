lecture_description: "This video presents the second part of the contribution by Flexcompute to the 4th High Lift Prediction Workshop based on the Flow360 solver. The best-practice RANS results are analyzed in further detail and compared with DES predictions with the aim to provide conclusions of the ability of RANS to predict high-lift flows. The DES results were found to significantly improve the comparison with experimental data and showed high confidence in terms of achieving the correct answer for the right reasons."
