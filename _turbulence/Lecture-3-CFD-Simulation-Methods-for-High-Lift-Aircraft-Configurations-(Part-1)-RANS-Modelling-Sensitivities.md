  Lecture 3: CFD Simulation Methods for High-Lift Aircraft Configurations (Part
  1) - RANS Modelling Sensitivities
lecture_description: >-
  This video presents the first part of the contribution by Flexcompute to the
  4th High Lift Prediction Workshop based on the Flow360 solver. The analysis of
  the high-lift prediction results is focused on examining RANS modeling
  sensitivities. This includes effects of mesh refinement and topology,
  turbulence modeling choices and solution initialization strategies, with the
  aim to provide best-practices for RANS simulations of high-lift
  configurations.
