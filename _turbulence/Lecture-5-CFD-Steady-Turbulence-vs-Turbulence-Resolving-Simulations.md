lecture_description: >-
  In this video, Dr. Spalart will show the differences between the steady-state
  RANS turbulence model, time-accurate unsteady RANS, Large Eddy Simulation
  (LES), and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES). We will show how RANS, LES, and DES
  are complementary to each other and all have their role to play in
  state-of-the-art CFD. Examples will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses
  of each turbulence modeling and/or turbulence resolving technique.
