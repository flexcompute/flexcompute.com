lecture_description: >-
  In this video, we will build a fuselage geometry. It can be constructed by
  blending a point and set of superellipse cross-sections. A rounded nose with
  customized radius was generated to demonstrate how to set up the “begList” for
  the blend command. Previously stored wing was restored and unioned with the
  fuselage to construct the full airplane geometry.
