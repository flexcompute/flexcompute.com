  In this video, we will demonstrate how to set up a CFD simulation in Flow360
  and check the simulation results via our WebUI. Before running the simulation,
  we will show how to set up the freestream condition, boundary conditions as
  well as other solver configurations. Once the simulation is completed, we will
  demonstrate how to check the convergence of residuals and examine the forces
  and moments acting on the airplane. Additionally, we will also show the online
  visualization of pressure and friction coefficients on the airplane, as well
  as the Q-criterion representing the vortices around the airplane.
