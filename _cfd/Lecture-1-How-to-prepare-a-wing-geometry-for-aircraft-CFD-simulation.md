lecture_description: 'In this video, we will first construct the aircraft wing. We will use parameterized geometry based on Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP). The wing will be based on a set of NACA 0012 airfoil cross-sections. The basic operations in ESP, including scale, rotate and translate were demonstrated. Rule and blend commands for constructing a solid body from a set of sheet bodies were elaborated. When using the blend command, a rounded tip was also added to the wing. The edges and faces were labeled for surface meshing as well as CFD simulations.'
