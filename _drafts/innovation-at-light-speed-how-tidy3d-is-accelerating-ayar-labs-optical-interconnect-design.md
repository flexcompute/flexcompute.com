Neil Sapra, Senior Photonic Design Engineer at Ayar Labs, faced a challenge when trying to model his optical interconnect components quickly and accurately enough to catch issues before production runs.&nbsp; Simulations are critical to avoid the substantial time and costs of physically prototyping these components, and larger simulation domains were intractable for Ayar Labs’ existing simulation tools.&nbsp; The long turnaround time for design and engineering processes forced Neil and his team to resort to approximations when modeling their devices. This left them wondering if they were catching every issue and designing the highest-possible-performing optical interconnects.&nbsp; Ayar Labs needed a solution that would enable them to iterate designs far faster in order to optimize performance, reduce risk, and accelerate time to market.

Fortunately, Neil heard from a colleague about Tidy3D, the FDTD simulation tool from Flexcompute, and its 10-100x speedups over traditional simulation tools.&nbsp; By picking

up Tidy3D, Ayar Labs could now finally simulate their devices in hours rather than days to weeks, providing valuable insights into the behavior of their silicon photonics components.&nbsp; Moreover, some devices were so enormous compared to their wavelengths of operation that full-3D simulation was made possible for the first time with Tidy3D.

Ayar Labs confirmed these simulations matched closely with actual device performance, so they could now trust Tidy3D to help them optimize their designs using the adjoint method. With the ability to simulate massive simulation domains, they also aim to identify and mitigate potential issues before moving to the manufacturing stage. Thus, reducing the risk of costly errors and delays.

In such a competitive and fast-moving industry as silicon photonics, speed to market is crucial. Optical interconnects promise to disrupt conventional computing architectures for disaggregated ones. Because Tidy3D plays an outsized role in streamlining Ayar Labs' product development cycle, this next-generation simulation tool gives Ayar a competitive edge and helps maintain their position as leaders in the industry.

Thanks also to the collaboration with Tidy3D’s support team, Ayar Labs implemented new features and optimized the code’s performance to their specific demands.&nbsp; Ultimately, Neil Sapra and his team were able to accelerate design iterations, optimize performance, reduce risk, and bring their cutting-edge technology to market faster and more efficiently than ever before.
