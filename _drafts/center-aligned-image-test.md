# A CFD study of the XV-15 tiltrotor

Despite a projected 40.3 million flights worldwide in 2020, airplanes actually have a major drawback. To take off, airplanes need to accelerate along a runway to reach the necessary speed to generate lift and become airborne. This limitation sparked the development of helicopters which use rotating rotor blades, instead of fixed-wings, to generate lift. This allows helicopters to take off and land vertically, removing the need for long runways.

However, helicopters come with their own restrictions which includes shorter ranges and slower speeds. Consequently, a new type of aircraft, the tiltrotor, was developed which combined the hover and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities of helicopters with the speed and range of airplanes.

As the name suggests, tiltrotors utilise tilting rotor blades that are mounted to shafts at the end of fixed wings. During vertical flight, the plane of rotation of the rotors is horizontal, generating lift in a similar way to a helicopter. As the aircraftâ€™s speed increases, the rotors progressively tilt forwards until the plane of rotation is vertical at cruising speeds. Here, the rotors act as propellors, providing thrust, while the fixed wings generate lift, just like an airplane.

The result is an aircraft which can switch between helicopter mode and airplane mode during flight, whilst achieving higher altitudes and greater speeds then a helicopter. These capabilities have attracted a huge amount of investment in the past and in the late 1960s, NASA together with Bell Helicopters developed the Bell XV-15 which has become the foundation for many VTOL aircrafts today.
