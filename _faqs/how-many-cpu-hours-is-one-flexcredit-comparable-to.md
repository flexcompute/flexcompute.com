title: How many CPU hours is one FlexCredit comparable to?
---

One FlexCredit is equivalent to about 50 hours of CPU core time when using the traditional FDTD method. That's the equivalent of running a computer processor core for two days straight, just for one FlexCredit!

If you have 60 FlexCredits, it's like having a 4-core CPU (which is a pretty powerful computer) running non-stop, 24 hours a day, for a full month.
