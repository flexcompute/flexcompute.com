title: How do I print the task log file?
---

To keep track of the details of a simulation, a log file is created that contains information about the simulation size, symmetries, number of computational grid points, time steps, shut off condition, and the time taken for simulation setup and running. If you need to print out the log file of a simulation, you can use the command&nbsp;`print(sim_data.log)`.&nbsp;
