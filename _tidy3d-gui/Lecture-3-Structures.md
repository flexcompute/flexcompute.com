title: "Tidy3D GUI: geometries and structures | Flexcompute"
description: "In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating structures commonly used when modeling electromagnetic devices. These structures include rectangles, cylinders, spheres, and polygons. We will reproduce the results of the dielectric metasurface absorber Python notebook. Afterwards, we will test it using different resonator shapes."
