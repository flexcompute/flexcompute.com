title: "Tidy3D GUI: symmetry conditions | Flexcompute"
description: "In most FDTD simulations, field symmetries can be used to significantly reduce computation by 1/2, 1/4, or even 1/8. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up symmetries based on the structure and source properties. As a practical example, we will show you how to properly set up symmetry conditions to excite the input waveguide of a photonic crystal slab polarization filter with both the fundamental TE and TM optical modes."
