title: "Tidy3D GUI: Mode solver set up and run | Flexcompute"
description: "This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the mode solver feature to obtain field distributions and effective indices of guided waveguide modes. The proper selection of mode properties is crucial when setting up mode sources and monitors in FDTD simulations. When designing photonic devices like directional couplers, mode converters, or mode de-multiplexers, conducting a mode analysis is also an essential task."
