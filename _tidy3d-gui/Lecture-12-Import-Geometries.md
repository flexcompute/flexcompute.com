title: "Tidy3D GUI: import geometries | Flexcompute"
description: "In this tutorial, we will guide you through importing geometries from existing 2D layouts or 3D CAD structures. This feature proves incredibly useful, allowing you to simulate final layouts of photonic devices in GDS files intended for fabrication or intricate 3D geometries in STL files. You will learn these features going though the examples of a focusing apodized grating coupler and a 2x2 MMI power splitter."
