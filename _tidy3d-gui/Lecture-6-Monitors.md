title: "Tidy3D GUI: monitor set up | Flexcompute"
description: "In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up various monitors to calculate and visualize data from FDTD simulations. To illustrate the process, we will use a focusing grating coupler built on a silicon-on-insulator platform. This coupler is used to vertically couple light into and out of photonic integrated circuits using optical fibers."
