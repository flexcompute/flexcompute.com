title: "Tidy3D GUI: simulation run time | Flexcompute"
description: "When setting up FDTD simulations, a common question is how long to run them in physical time. In this tutorial, you will learn how to properly set up the run time of FDTD simulations to obtain accurate results. We will also show you how to use the shutoff condition to avoid running simulations longer than necessary."
