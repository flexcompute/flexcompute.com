title: "Tidy3D GUI: advanced set up using scripts | Flexcompute"
description: "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use script objects in the Tidy3D GUI to easily create complex geometries. This feature is useful for building devices such as photonic crystals, metasurfaces, waveguide bends, and tapers. We will demonstrate how to create a photonic crystal L3 cavity."
