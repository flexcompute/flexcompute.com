title: "Tidy3D GUI: grid specification | Flexcompute"
description: "In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up the FDTD grid to obtain accurate simulation results. We will demonstrate the differences between uniform and non-uniform grids, and how to utilize them to optimize the simulation mesh. Additionally, you will learn how to calculate the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes of a directional coupler."
