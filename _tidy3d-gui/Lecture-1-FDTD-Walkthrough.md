title: "Tidy3D GUI: FDTD simulation walkthrough | Flexcompute"
description: "This tutorial guides you through the basics of setting up and running FDTD simulations using a simple waveguide example in the graphical user interface (GUI). Specifically, you will learn how to create a silicon waveguide, set up a mode source to excite that waveguide using the fundamental transverse electric optical mode, and how to run the FDTD simulation to obtain the coupling efficiency and field distribution."
