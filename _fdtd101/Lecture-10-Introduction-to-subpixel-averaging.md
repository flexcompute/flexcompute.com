lecture_description: "In this lecture, we discuss a powerful method known as subpixel averaging that enables the <a href='/tidy3d/learning-center/' id='__pg_fdtd101_lecture-10_fdtd' class='color-primary-hover'>FDTD</a> algorithm to capture geometric features below the discretization level. We discuss the basic ideas as well as	some subtleties associated with subpixel averaging."
container: "- Take the simulation of the slab transmission spectrum in 1D as an example, show the simplest scheme of subpixel averaging: spatial average of the dielectric function within each unit cell. The permittivity assignment over the Yee-grid will vary even for a small change of the slab thickness below the grid size.<br />
- Show the derivation of the subpixel averaging formula based on Ampereâ€™s law for the tangential component of the electric field that is parallel to the interface."
