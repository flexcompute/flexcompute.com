This paper discusses Anderson localization, which is the phenomenon where the propagation of diffusive waves is halted in disordered systems. Despite extensive research spanning 40 years, the localization of light in three dimensions has remained elusive, raising questions about whether it actually occurs. The text presents numerical evidence of three-dimensional localization of vector electromagnetic waves occurring within random collections of metallic spheres that overlap, which is in stark contrast to the lack of localization observed in dielectric spheres with refractive indices as high as 10 in air.
