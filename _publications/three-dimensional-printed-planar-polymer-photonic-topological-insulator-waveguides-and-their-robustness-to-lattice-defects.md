In this work, the authors present a design for planar photonic topological waveguides characterized by low index contrast. Notably, they create these waveguides using polymeric materials through three-dimensional printing, allowing for rapid device fabrication. To assess the topological protection of these waveguides, they employ high-speed finite-difference time-domain simulations, particularly focusing on "omega" shaped bent topological waveguides.
