This paper presents photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) and their potential for creating large-area single-mode lasers. Scaling up PCSELs while maintaining single-mode operation is challenging, and it has impeded progress in achieving very large PCSELs. This scaling challenge arises from the diminishing quality-factor (Q) contrast between the fundamental laser mode and higher-order modes as the lateral size of the crystal increases. The text introduces the concept of bound states in the continuum (BIC), which can address this challenge.
