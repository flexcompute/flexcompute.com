In this paper, the authors propose a programmable photonic crystal cavity array and demonstrate near-complete control over the spatiotemporal properties of a 64 resonator, two-dimensional spatial light modulator with nanosecond- and femtojoule-order switching. Simultaneously operating wavelength-scale modes near the space–bandwidth and time–bandwidth limits, this work opens a new regime of programmability at the fundamental limits of multimode optical control.
