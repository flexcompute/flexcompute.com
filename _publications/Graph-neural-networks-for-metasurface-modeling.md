This paper introduces a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). This GNN architecture is designed to learn and model electromagnetic scattering and can be applied to metasurfaces of arbitrary sizes. Importantly, it considers the coupling between scatterers. As a result, this approach allows for the rapid calculation of near-fields for metasurfaces. Additionally, the approach can also be used for the inverse design of large metasurfaces, offering a versatile tool for electromagnetic field modeling and design.
