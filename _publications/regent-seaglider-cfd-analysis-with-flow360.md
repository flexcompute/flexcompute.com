REGENT, a North Kingstown, Rhode Island based company, is designing and building ”seagliders”. REGENT’s seaglider is a fully electric vehicle that utilizes a blown wing and hydrofoils for takeoff from the water, instead of gas powered engines and a hull used by traditional seaplanes. Once airborne, the seaglider flies within a wing span of the water surface as a wing-in-ground-effect to take advantage of the cushion of air that forms between the vehicle and the water surface, improving efficiency. Such an efficient commuter transport will be greatly beneficial for passengers traveling between coastal cities. Seagliders are a much more efficient alternative to traditional hopper flights and a much faster alternative to traditional ferry routes.
