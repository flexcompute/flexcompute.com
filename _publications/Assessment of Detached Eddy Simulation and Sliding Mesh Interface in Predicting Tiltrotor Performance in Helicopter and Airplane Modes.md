This paper presents numerical investigation on performance and flow field of the full-scale XV-15 tiltrotor in both helicopter mode (hovering flight and forward flight) and aeroplane propeller mode using Detached Eddy Simulation, in which the movement of the rotor is achieved using a Sliding Mesh Interface. Comparison of our CFD results against experiment data and other CFD results is performed and presented.
