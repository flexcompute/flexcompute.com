lecture_description: "In this lecture, we give a broad introduction to the concept of computational design in photonics. We show how simulation and mathematical optimization can be combined to analyze and design photonic devices effectively."
container: "Specifically, we will discuss how to set up an objective function and the notion of design “parameters”, which represent the knobs that we can tune as photonic design engineers to optimize our device. We motivate the usefulness of computing the gradient of our objective function with respect to these design parameters and show how this information can be used for efficient, iterative optimization."
