lecture_description: "In this lecture, we show how to use the previously introduced “adjoint variable method” to perform gradient-based optimization of a focusing lens. We set up a simple device based on a pixellated array of permittivity values, compute the gradient of this array with respect to the focusing strength of our lens, and then perform an optimization to achieve a final device that focuses light successfully."
