  page_title: 'Introduction to Turbulence Modeling in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)'
  description: "Turbulence models use mathematical approximations to predict complex flow behavior. It is a very complex science that still confuses most CFD users. Which turbulence model to choose? One equation or two equation models? Wall functions? What are the pros and cons of the most common models? When should CFD users trust which models? And so on… In this video series on CFD turbulence modeling we will have Dr. Philippe Spalart, of Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model fame, explain the problems faced by the CFD community when it comes to modeling turbulence.<br> <br> We will also explore the problems associated with turbulence modeling and how the models solve those issues. The latest state of the art in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), and other types of CFD will be covered. More specifically, we’ll review how each type of CFD tackles the complex problem of turbulence. Additional focus will be given to the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) and k-ω SST models and when to use them, as well as wall functions. Our implementation techniques, requirements, best practices, tips, and tricks will be presented using real world examples and suggestions."
